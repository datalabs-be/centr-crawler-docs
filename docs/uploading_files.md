To upload a sample of your zone file, you need this information:

* Your access key ID
* Your secret key
* The name of the S3 bucket for your TLD

You can find this information on when you generate a new key.

You have several options to upload a sample of your zone file:

* Use the command line tool `s3cmd`
* Use the AWS SDK for your preferred programming language
* Use a tool with a graphical user interface, like [Cyberduck](https://cyberduck.io/)
* and many more.

We will describe some of these options in the next sections.
* [Upload with s3cmd](./upload_with_s3cmd.md)
* [Upload using Python and boto3](./upload_with_python.md)
                             
More details about the monthly sample can be found [here](./monthly_sample.md).
